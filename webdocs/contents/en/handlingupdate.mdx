To handle updates you can use 2 methods. 
## Using onNewMessage 
Only new message will receive with this method. 
```ts:index.ts {1} showLineNumbers 
bot.onNewMessage(ctx => {})
```
`ctx` is JSON update from telegram which we have added a prototype like `ctx.reply` 
## Using onNewEvent 
All event will receive with this method. 
```ts:index.ts {1} showLineNumbers 
bot.onNewEvent(event => {})
```
`event` is pure JSON update from telegram.
